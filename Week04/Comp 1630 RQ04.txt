Review Questions Lesson 4

1. What is normalization?
Normalization is a process which is done in steps in order to reduce redundancies and create logical table structures. The goal is to create entities that are simple, non-redundant, stable, and adaptable/flexible. 

2. When is a table in 1NF?
This is when every instance in a table has at most 1 value per attribute.

3. When is a table in 2NF?
This is when all non-pk attributes are dependent on the PK.

4. When is a table in 3NF?
this is when all non-pk attributes are not dependent on any other non-pk attribute. 

5. Partial dependency is when a proper subset of the determinate can still determine the dependent. It is associated with 2NF.

6. Update, insertion, and deletion anomalies. The can be eliminated through the process of normalization. 

7. Nouns are associated with entities. Verbs are associated with relationships.

8. A supertype entity has the common entities that are inherited by each of its subtypes.
