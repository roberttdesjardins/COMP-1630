13. AND means that both sides of the statement must be true, for the statement to be true.
IE: 
T & T = T
T & F = F
F & T = F
F & F = F

OR means that either side of the statement must be true. Inclusive or. 
T & T = T
T & F = T
F & T = T
F & F = F

NOT means that that value will evaluate to false and all others will evaluate to true. So if a where clause says NOT NULL then anything that is NULL will evaluate to false. 
!T = F
!F = T

14. 
SELECT: Retrieves the specified columns from a table
INSERT: Creates new rows in a table
