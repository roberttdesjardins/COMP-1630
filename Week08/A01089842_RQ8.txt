The GROUP BY clause combines all results that are identical in a certain column. This is useful for aggregate functions such as MAX or COUNT when applied to another column. The result will show the aggreate function for that column for each unique column which the table is grouped by.

11. 
the HAVING clause is used along with the GROUP BY clause as a WHERE clause which also can work with aggreate functions.

12. 
The ROLLUP clause is used after stating the columns to group by, and provides subtotals.

13. Inner joins are a join which do not include any results from either table which do not have a matching result in the other table. This is the most efficient type of join.
